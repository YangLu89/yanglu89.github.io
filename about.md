Hello.

I am a backend engineer working at a startup company. My main focus is RESTful API design, but I'm also a big fan of frontend design. I love movies and novels, I love things that are concise, beautiful and useful. I'm trying to become a more helpful and useful person. I'm trying to create things that make the world better.

Enjoy!
